Signals
~~~~~~~

The following `Signals`_ can be used to implement support for different file types in Tumpara.
These are sent when scanning a library produces some sort of change.

Some pass the library's ``context`` value as the sender â€“
this value is user-provided and determines what greater part of the application should handle the contents for each library.
For example, video files in a library intended for storing home video may be indexed and managed differently than video in a library intended for storing movies.
